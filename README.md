# NextMoveSF

[NextMoveSF][nextmovesf] is a data visualization tool that helps people pick the San Francisco neighborhood that's right for them. It utilizes React.js with a Redux implementation of Flux architecture on the frontend, and Ruby on Rails on the backend.

## Project Design

NextMoveSF was designed and built in two weeks by me, Daniel Fletcher.

A [proposal][proposal] was drafted to help provide an implementation timeline during the development process.

Alongside the design proposal, I prepared a [database schema][schema], [component hierarchy][components], and a series of [wireframes][wireframes] for the user interface.
